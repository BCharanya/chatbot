# Chatbot
Interactive NLP Chatbot with Wikipedia Integration and GUI in Python

This project features an interactive chatbot that retrieves information from Wikipedia and responds to user queries. The bot processes input using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and stopword filtering, while providing real-time responses via a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. It also supports multilingual capabilities by integrating translation services, enabling it to handle queries in various languages.

**Key Features:**

**Wikipedia Integration:** The chatbot queries Wikipedia and fetches summaries for user queries.

**NLP Processing:** The chatbot uses NLTK to tokenize the input and filter out stopwords, improving the quality of search queries.

**Multilingual Support:** Translates user input into English using the Google Translate API for effective Wikipedia queries.

**Voice Input:** Users can interact with the chatbot using voice commands via Google Speech Recognition.

**Voice Output:** The chatbot responds with synthesized speech using pyttsx3 for a more interactive experience.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The chatbot features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, where users can either type their queries or speak them.
